# Federated Learning Simulation 

Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized approach to Machine Learning where clients retain their own data and train models locally. Instead of sharing data, they share model parameters, which are averaged and used to update a global model on the central server. 
thanks to [flower](https://github.com/adap/flower) implementing FL has become incredibly easy! ðŸŒŸ

## Steps to running the simulation:

1. create virtual env and activate it
2. install all packages required by running ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
3. run main.py : `python3 main.py`
4. you will get the all the output logs in `/outputs`
